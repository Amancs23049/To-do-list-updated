2. Testing Results

Add a small testing report or summary:

3. Issues Faced / Observed

List small issues or bugs you encountered:

1. Merge conflict occurred when the same file was edited in two branches.
2. Duplicate tasks created when added in multiple branches.
3. File naming conflict: Task.js and task.js treated as separate files.
4. Task added without validation allowed empty task.
5. Mobile layout slightly breaks on very small screens.

4. Solutions / Fixes

Write how each issue was resolved:

- Merge conflicts: Resolved manually by editing conflicting files.
- Duplicate tasks: Added check to prevent adding same task twice.
- File naming conflict: Removed duplicate/renamed file to standardize.
- Empty tasks: Added validation to prevent empty task entry.
- Mobile layout: Fixed using CSS media queries.

5. Observations / Improvements

Add ideas for future improvements:

- Implement local storage to save tasks permanently.
- Add task priorities (High/Medium/Low) with color codes.
- Add due dates and reminders for tasks.
- Dark/light mode toggle for better UX.
- Drag-and-drop task ordering.
